Description: Model stacking is an ensemble technique
    that involves training a model to combine the outputs of many 
    diverse statistical models, and has been shown to improve 
    predictive performance in a variety of settings. 'stacks' 
    implements a grammar for 'tidymodels'-aligned model stacking.
